                            <div>IT HAS A DEEPER MEANING INSIDE</div>
                            <br>
                            <div>In hummed melodies and sung poetry,</div>
<div>Not one thrummed the strings contently,</div>
<div>Until his cries were heard amongst seekers of conquest,</div>
<div>It was then she became the first fallen leaf of a forest</div>
<br>
<div>Four days for white to become red,</div>
<div>Four reasons why her heart bled,</div>
<div>It ached for a soul so used and broken,</div>
<div>She offered a piece of her heart for it to mend.</div>

<div>His smile was sweet cut persimmons,</div>
<div>His laughter was an angel's fingers on harp strings,</div>
<div>His eyes were glow-in-the-dark stars of a daydream,</div>
<div>His hands were of craftsmanship done intricately.</div>
<div>He shines brighter than the morning star,</div>
<br>
<div>A being of holy and unholy,</div>
<div>Who believes in righteousness and thruth,</div>
<div>Yet his tongue is twisted for he lies.</div>
<div>Lies that he is a monument better forgotten,</div>
<br>
<div>Lies that he is shards of glass tainted with blood,</div>
<div>Lies that he is a man with no freedom of mind and heart,</div>
<div>Lies that he no longer needs tears to shed.</div>
<br>
<div>For there is no hope,</div>
<div>No dream worth dreaming,</div>
<div>No path worth taking,</div>
<div>No love worth risking</div>
<br>
<div>He lies to himself,</div>
<div>willing to hurt himself in the end</div>
<div>So I desperately beg</div>
<div>In the eyes of a willing heart to lend</div>
<div>I love you belle</div>

                            <p>(4 march 2021) Dear  if I could only tell you how much I have admired you since class 10.  I wanted to tell you but I felt inadequate. O fell I'm not good for you, you'll never love me the way I love you. It sometime becomes painful. So I try to stay as far from you as possible. It's more painful now..as I can talk to you..but I don't know what to talk and I don't want to disturb you. Nor do I want to lose you. For I love you and love you and love you</p>

                            <p>oii lombu.I just wanted to hop on here and say i really love talking to you (i don't think i ever told you this, but then you know my fleeting memory ;~; )
If i were to chose between you and all my other friends here to spend n entire day with ( perhaps my entire college days) i would chose you over nd over again , because i really enjoy your company.
OKKK i'm done, aaahhh! bad with expressing you see...kill me ( hogaya ab , ja jake maggi kha XD )</p>

    <p>What can I say?!
Well I would like to tell I love you and Romi too without a any reason and I really wanted to show you a few things and highlight your fears to bring it down and I expected atleast you to be open towards me so that I can atleast help you with them so you can get over it as I really wanted you to get over a few fears as I really cared about you I got my message and my feelings clear.
The ones who care will always make their feelings for your clear.They won't lose anyone over something as petty as their ego

If you listen carefully enough,if you read their texts someone will tell you exactly the kind of person they are something definitely will tell you.Sit back, and listen and you can understand anyone and their feelings
How do you know if a person values you?
----You would not even be questioning it. That is why I never questioned you anytime and we'll you questioned me you blocked me due to anger it's that you were impulsive it did hurt because it matters
 it's just that I want to know my friends past to not punish them or deride them but to understand how they needed to be loved but then I am clearly wrong because sometimes you can be too much for someone and you have to be ok with letting them go back to what they were used to because ultimately friends understand your anti-social phases and done take them personally are important

I always try to make people smile even when I can't but I believe in a few things:-

1)if I care I will show it
2)if I miss someone I will call them

Remember "Every next level of your life will demand a different you" and all I want after this is you "TO BE YOU" and don't dilute yourself for someone's interests and this is what I like about you all I want is you to be yourself that's it and you are good as you are and I want your forgiveness if ever hurt you
It's is okay if you need time to forgive
It is okay if you are unable to
It is okay if the if the only thing to give is time for yourself to heal
From what they say you need to give forgiveness to
And yes thanks a lot for Romki video it made by day

Have a nice day :)</p>
